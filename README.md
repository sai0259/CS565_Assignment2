2020FA CS565 Assignment 2, Junehyeong Park (https://github.com/sai0259/CS565_Assignment2)


For Question 1,

Q1_mod.m: the matlab code using 'Regression Learner' toolbox to predict 'z.csv' based on predictors 'x.csv' and 'y.csv' so that print 'z_predicted.csv'

x.csv, y.csv, and z.csv: input files for the question 1 of Assignment 1

z_predicted.csv: output file for the question 1 of Assignment 1


For Question 2,

Q2_mod.m: the matlab code using K-Means and GMM for clustering 'p2-data' (the code includes the clustering using neural network method, but I commented it to neglect)

cluster_GMM.png: the clustering results using GMM with cases for different covariance sturcture options and different initual conditions

clustered.csv: the csv file including clustered points that each row represents each cluster, and the number on the each row represents the indexes of points included in the cluster

CS565_Assignment2_JunehyeongPark.pdf: discussions on how the GMM clustering method was applied
