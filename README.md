2020FA CS565 Assignment 2, Junehyeong Park (https://github.com/sai0259/CS565_Assignment2)

For Question 1,
Q1.m: the matlab code using 'Regression Learner' toolbox to predict 'z.csv' based on predictors 'x.csv' and 'y.csv' so that print 'z_predicted.csv'
x.csv, y.csv, and z.csv: input files for the question 1 of Assignment 1
z_predicted.csv: output file for the question 1 of Assignment 1

For Question 2,
Q2.m: the matlab code using K-Means and GMM for clustering 'p2-data' (the code includes the clustering using neural network method, but I commented it to neglect)
kmeans_0##.png: the clustering results using K-Means, and of course the results will be different for every trials
cluster_GMM_#.png: the clustering results using GMM with cases for different covariance sturcture options and different initual conditions
